# Machine Learning Assignment: Decision Trees and k-Fold Cross-Validation

## Overview
This assignment involves implementing decision trees and k-fold cross-validation from scratch, without using machine learning libraries. The assignment includes the following components:

- **Decision Trees:** Implement the ID3 algorithm for classification tasks and apply reduced error pruning to enhance the model.
- **k-Fold Cross-Validation:** Train and evaluate a logistic regression model using the saga solver from scikit-learn, without applying any regularization penalties.

## Installation
To install the necessary packages, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main folders:

### Decision Trees
- **code.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm and reduced error pruning.
- **report.pdf:** PDF document with cell outputs and explanations related to the decision tree implementation.

### Cross Validation
- **code.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of k-fold cross-validation using logistic regression.
- **report.pdf:** PDF document with cell outputs and explanations for the k-fold cross-validation implementation.
